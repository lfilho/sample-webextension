<body>
  <h2 data-testid="bad-page">Oops...</h2>

  <p>
    This is a simple and synchronous way to test the extension is actually
    working: if you can see this via the iframe on
    <strong>test_page.html</strong>, the extension DID NOT work (did not block
    the request to this page, but it should have).
  </p>

  <p>Instead of this page, this could have been a tracker.</p>

      <strong>Note:</strong>
      <span>
        This page has no use on its own. It exists only to test the extension
        via <strong>test_page.html</strong>
      </span>
